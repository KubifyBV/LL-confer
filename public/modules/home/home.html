        <p class="text-primary">Confer provides online collaboration spaces for working groups that can be used both synchronously as well as asynchronously. 
            Confer supports your group to work collaboratively on a task or project; helping to keep the work focused and flowing, recording the discussions and reasoning along the way and producing a final summary output that can become the first draft of your report or recommendations</p>
